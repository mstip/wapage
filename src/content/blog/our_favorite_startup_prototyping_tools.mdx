As an entrepreneur, you know this situation: There is this awesome product idea you want to build. You pitched at events, you did a lot of research, you talked to a lot of people, and you know the world is only waiting for your next big thing. But what's next? 
You know, the only thing missing is a prototype to test if your potential customers really want your product. Only one step to achieve the product market fit.
But there are dozens of low and no code tools out there to build prototypes, so which one should you choose? To help you not get lost in tool research, we created this list of our favorite prototyping tools, no coding skills required ; )
## Paper prototyping
The most no code solution possible, All you need is pen and paper, and maybe some glue and scissors. 
We love paper prototypes as it really helps you to focus on the core functionalities of your app. It's one of the best tools to get early feedback from a group of interested people. Sure, they have to be in a room with you, but this gives you the opportunity to observe their reactions and behaviors when they're using the prototype.
This method is really cost-efficient, and you can have a high iteration speed.
Our recommendation: Do a workshop and craft your paper prototype together with a group of potential customers, the insights you get in just an afternoon will be invaluable.
## Proto.io
The next no code tool on this list is proto.io. Where Paper prototypes are somehow abstract, Proto.io will let you build prototypes which look and feel “real”. With its preset of common widgets like buttons, forms, images, sliders, and toolbars, it helps you build a mobile prototype as fast as possible. 
When other tools overwhelm you with all their freedom and possibilities, then Proto.io will make you focus on the more important topics.
You can easily share your prototypes online with your potential customers and don't need to be in the same room as they are. Proto.io offers a free 15 days trail to let you test if the tool fits your needs.
## Figma
This is the Swiss army knife of prototyping. Figma manged to be the industry standard for prototyping within the last years, and for a good reason. Here you can find all tools you require for a professional prototype. With Figma’s presentation option, you can create interactive prototypes which you can share with everyone or embed into your website. And you can use it for free forever, the paid plans will give you unlimited projects, but you don't need them in the beginning. We are huge fans of Figma and do all of our prototypes, wireframes, and designs with it. But be aware that you have to invest a couple of hours to learn it, if you are not familiar with this kind of tools. But once you know it, you will be an unstoppable prototyping force ; )
## Bubble.io
Bubble is the most stable and feature rich low code tool we know and recommend. You are able to build real apps without writing one line of code. It works very well for low to mid complex apps. Its performance is good enough for you to definitely survive your first 1000 customers. You can easily extend it with the huge amount of plugins available or embedded other tools via API calls. If you get stuck, you can contact one of the listed Bubble agencies to help you. Let's take a look at the costs. You start with the starter plan for $29 and probably have to use the growth plan for $119 very fast. Our honest opinion is that this seems to be a lot, but is more than reasonable as you can earn your first money with it. When you plan to use bubble, understand that you have to invest at least a week to understand it if you have no background in app development. 
I hope this list of tools help you not to suffer from research fatigue and get your product idea as fast as possible to your customers.
